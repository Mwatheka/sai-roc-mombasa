            <h2>Join the Old Town Walking Tour</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Exploring <b>Mombasa Old Town</b> is the best way to start your trip along the coast. It gives you a glimpse of how different cultures have lived harmoniously on the island for ages. You’ll spot old buildings along the narrow alleys reflecting the inhabitants’ rich heritage – locals, Arabs, Asians, and Europeans. With fine curved doors and beautiful balconies, the old houses symbolize rich history and architecture. During the stroll, you’ll see the Old Post Office, Africa Hotel, and more interesting sites. Make sure you walk along the main street (Ndia Kuu). You don’t need a guide to explore Mombasa Old Town. However, if you want to see the old suburb with knowledgeable locals, join this exciting tour, or this one.
            </p>
            <h2>Nyali Beach (One of the Best Places to Visit in Mombasa)</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                If you’re like me and love the ocean, there’s no better place for a coastal experience than Nyali Beach. The beach is close to Mombasa and offers a serene environment for relaxation. Besides walking along the beach, you can go surfing, swimming, and sunbathing at Nyali Beach. The beach is clean, less crowded, and scenic. It also hosts several beach resorts and hotels, restaurants, and bars for more enjoyment.
            </p>
            <h2>Have a Street Food Experience</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The Swahili cuisine is a beautiful blend of different cultures that live along the Kenyan coast. It includes local, Arabic, European, and Indian influences. Trips to Mombasa are made all the better when you sample the local Swahili food. A typical Swahili dish consists of rice and various spices, like cloves and coriander. The rice is prepared with different ingredients such as fish, chicken, and beef to make the dish delicious.
            </p>
            <h2>Learn to Cook a Swahili Meal</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                It’s one thing to eat a local meal, but another experience entirely to prepare one for yourself. If you’d like to get busy in the kitchen and cook your favorite Swahili dish, join this cooking experience. You’ll visit a local market to shop for ingredients and prepare the dish. This is also a great opportunity to learn about the Swahili culture from your local guide.
            </p>
            <h2>Visit Fort Jesus Museum</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                A guided tour of Fort Jesus Museum is highly recommended. The museum is located in the Old Town and was built between 1593 and 1596 as a Portuguese fort to guard the Old Port of Mombasa. Gaspar Rodrigues used the designs of Giovanni Battista Cairati to build the fort under the orders of King Felipe II of Castille.
            </p>
            <h2>Explore a Local Market</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Kongowea Market is located a short drive from Mombasa town. The market is more than simply a place to buy affordable clothes, household items, groceries, and fruits. It’s a meeting point, an unofficial cultural center, and the home of delicious food. A walking tour of Kongowea Market is one of the best activities in Mombasa. It allows you to engage with locals and learn about their way of life. You can also shop for fresh fruits and vegetables and test your bargaining skills.
            </p>
            <h2>Relax at the Mama Ngina Waterfront</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                There are many fun things to do in Mombasa, but nothing gives me more joy than relaxing by the seaside at Mama Ngina Waterfront. The ocean breeze, freshly fried cassava crisps, tugboats pulling ships, and sights of beautifully lit ferries in the evening – once experienced, these things live forever in one’s mind. Mama Ngina Waterfront is a public park that overlooks Kilindini Harbour. It’s a beautiful place to relax and unwind and is one of the most affordable places to visit in Mombasa. If I were to recommend just one place to <b>visit in Mombasa</b>, it would be this breathtaking waterfront. Whilst there, ride on one of the Likoni ferries to see the enchanting beauty of the coast in the evening.
            </p>
            <h2>Go Diving and Snorkeling</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The best beaches, historical sites, markets, and other tourist sites in Mombasa are easily accessible. This is why the city’s a good choice for travelers looking to do some sightseeing. Mombasa is also an amazing diving destination in Kenya, thanks to Mombasa Marine National Park and Reserve. The park is home to various marine attractions, including coral reefs, sea urchins, many different fish species, turtles, and migratory birds. If you intend to go diving in Mombasa, the best dive sites include the MV Dania and the MV Globe Star wrecks. Diving trips can be arranged from your hotel or through a reputable operator like Peponi Divers. Besides viewing marine life and diving in Mombasa Marine Park, you can engage in other activities like swimming, snorkeling, and windsurfing. The park can be accessed by boat from different points along the coast, including Nyali Beach and Serena Beach.

            <h2>Enjoy a Rare Wildlife Experience</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Similar to the Nguuni Nature Sanctuary, Haller Park (Bamburi Nature Trail) was once a wasteland, now turned into a diverse and unique ecosystem. Today, the park is home to a wildlife sanctuary, animal orphanage, reptile park, fish farm, butterfly pavilion, botanical garden, and forest trail.
            </p>
            <h2>Go-Karting (One of the Best Things to Do in Mombasa) </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                One of my favorite places to visit in Mombasa is the popular Mombasa Go-Kart. While I don’t always race, watching friends compete while I enjoy a cold Tusker is a great sight. If you love exhilarating adventures, make sure to visit the Mombasa Go-Kart. Their track is well designed, the go-karts are of high quality, and the staff is very helpful.             
            </p>
            <h2> Have Fun at the Wild Waters Kenya</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                If you’re looking for more fun activities in Mombasa, there’s no better place than Wild Waters Kenya. The water park (located in Nyali) offers thrilling entertainment to individuals, groups, and families. Their full-day activities include swimming and taking a plunge down water slides. You can also float and chill in a pool or hang out in their food courts or bar. The different slides and play areas are for everyone. Kids can have fun in the kid’s pool, on the family slide, and play station. The thrilling spiral slide (my favorite) is great for adults seeking to unleash their adventurous spirit.               
            </p>
            <h2> Party at the Moonshine Beach Bar</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Mombasa is home to some of the best nightlife spots in Kenya. If you have a spare evening after your Mombasa tour, a night out in the city or its outskirts is not to be missed. If you’re looking for a bar where you can hang out and enjoy your favorite drink, try the <b>Moonshine Beach Bar</b>.              
            </p>
            <h2>Take a Photo with the Mombasa Tusks </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Located over Moi Avenue, Mombasa Tusks are M-shaped giant elephant tusks made from aluminum. The tusks were first installed in 1952 to commemorate a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Mombasa. After the expansion of the road into two lanes in 1956, new tusks were constructed.              
            </p>
            <h2>Day Trip to Tsavo National Parks </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Besides historical sites and beaches, there are other attractions near Mombasa, including national parks and reserves. These wildlife parks are home to some of Kenya’s rarest species of flora and fauna. If you want an authentic safari experience in Mombasa, take a day trip to Tsavo National Parks. Tsavo East National Park is home to the big five (the lion, leopard, rhino, elephant, and buffalo), Lugard Falls, and various bird species. On the other hand, Tsavo West is famous for wildlife viewing and attractions such as Mzima Springs.              
            </p>
            <h2>Take a Trip to Watamu </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                None of my holidays in Mombasa are complete without a quick trip to Watamu. This small town is somewhat of a hidden jewel and a must-visit for any traveler hungry for white sand beaches Besides relaxing at Watamu Beach, my favorite activities here include visiting Mida Creek and the Ruins of Gedi. Watamu is also a nice place for watersports activities and nature experiences. You can explore the beach town from Hemingways Watamu and eat at the Crab Shack Dabaso.

            <h2>Mombasa Night Life </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                <b>Mombasa nightlife</b> is the best I've tried so far in East Africa, compared to that of Nairobi and Kisumu or Eldoret it is less conservative and far more foreigner-friendly. Even though its largely Muslim drinking alcohol is allowed, you can find nearly a hundred Mombasa bars and Mombasa nightclubs, some of which are busy even on weekdays. There is a huge diversity of venues: Jazz lounges, rooftop bars, expat pubs, open-air nightclubs, beach cafés, speakeasies, etc Mombasa has one of the wildest night scenes in East Africa, only rivaled by Nairobi’s nightlife. This city has very many good clubs, that are full from Monday to Sunday, and finding the one that fits you can be hard. I have made a list of the Top 10 Clubs in Mombasa to make your choice easier.

          <h2>Getting to Bamburi Beach</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Bamburi Beach is located on the north coast, along the Mombasa-Malindi Road and opposite the Bamburi Cement Factory. It borders Nyali Beach to the south and Shanzu beach to the north. With little traffic it takes approximate 20 minutes to get to Bamburi beach from Mombasa city or Mtwapa town. If you are from the neighborhood, you can use one of the many access points heading to the beach.  The beach is also close to other exciting recreational attractions like the Bamburi Nature Trail, Bamburi Haller Park, the Butterfly farm and shopping malls.
          </p>
          <h2>When to Go</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            At certain times of the year, there is soft seaweed on the beach that can be a bit unpleasant especially if you want to relax or swim by the shore. However, the sea usually cleans them off naturally especially around the months of October to April.  Some hotels too have joined hands to clean the beach but protected reserve areas are not interfered with. Bamburi Beach is usually a busy beach and quite crowded. Especially on weekends and holidays in December and January, families and tourists head to the beach to enjoy and unwind after a busy week; so do the traders and beach boys who want to cash in from the high numbers of visitors. Unlike the public beach, there are areas where hotels have private beaches and they are less crowded.
